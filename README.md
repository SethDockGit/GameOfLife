# GameOfLife

A C# console application based on Conway's "Game of Life" that renders a grid based on an initial set of values, then re-renders the grid based on a set of logical parameters. This application employs 2-dimensional bool arrays and for loops for it's rendering functionality as well as a static settings class which allows to manipulate the display.
